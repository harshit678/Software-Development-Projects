TEST FAILED for test07.txt. (15% similarity)

TEST FAILED for test08.txt. (55% similarity)

-----
(3) Code formatting and structure:

Positive aspects:

- Good formatting and structure of the code that facilitates reading
  and understanding.

- Good naming conventions for functions and variables.

- Appropriate use of code segmentation (i.e. function creation and
  use) that facilitates the usability and eventual maintainability of
  your solution.

Improvement opportunities:

- Instead of having large functions, it is a good practice to divide
  your program into small pieces of functionality defined in
  well-defined functions. Functions should have a unique intention and a
  very clear scope. This facilitates the re-usability and maintainability
  of your code.

- In the future, please write documentation and comments at a level and
  granularity that will prove the most useful. One approach to this is
  to pretend you are writing notes to yourself six months in the future,
  someone who would need to understand what you did that cannot be
  immediately discerned from the text of the program itself.
